# 🎥MovieApp
###  A efficient and clean application with movies and no ads, which includes mechanisms for personalizing videos using an AI engine. 


## 💡Idea 
I want to include basic functionalities in first MVP:
- **Video matched by AI** - use AI engine to match the films by the user prompt in search engine.
- **Menu with categories** - options to choose categories of films which we want to watch. 
- **Cards including film details** - after choosing the category, the user will see a list of cards with the film title, genre and rating. The user can click on the card and see more details about the film.
- **Details Page** - after clicking user can read more info about choosen movie and see similiar movies to choosen one
#### 🔖Later plans
- **Sign In** - in the future, I'd like to create the ability to create an account and add videos to user's own library
- **Video matching** - when the user adds a movie to the library, it will be taken into account the next time the movie is matched after answering the questions
