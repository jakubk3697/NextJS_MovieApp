# 🎥MovieApp
###  A efficient and clean application with movies and no ads, which includes mechanisms for personalizing videos using an AI engine. 


## 💡Idea 
I want to include basic functionalities in first MVP:
- **Video matched by AI** - use AI engine to match the films by the user prompt in search engine.
- **Menu with categories** - options to choose categories of films which we want to watch. 
- **Cards including film details** - after choosing the category, the user will see a list of cards with the film title, genre and rating. The user can click on the card and see more details about the film.
- **Details Page** - after clicking user can read more info about choosen movie and see similiar movies to choosen one
- **Sign In** - the user has the ability to create an account and add videos to the "favorite" videos category.
#### 🔖Later plans
- **Video Matching** - feature that displays recommended videos based on a user's database of favorite videos or the types of videos the user has viewed early on.
- **Handling repeated user prompts** - Build a mechanism that will analyze the prompt typed by the user. If another user typed the same prompt (keywords) the answer will be returned from the database instead of the AI API (due to cost)
