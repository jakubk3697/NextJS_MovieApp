## Problem to solve
Very often I'd like to watch a movie but I have no specific ideas about genre, actors or year of the film. I was looking for an app where I could answer some out-of-the-box questions, about my mood, some thoughts etc. and be able to easily get movies that would match my answers. My second idea is to be able to give prompts to AI and receive ready-made cards with videos and necessary data.

## 💡Idea
I created initial layout on the Miro platform. Basic concepts:
- **Video matched by AI** - use AI engine to match the films by the user prompt in search engine.
- **Menu with categories** - options to choose categories of films which we want to watch. 
- **Cards including film details** - after choosing the category, the user will see a list of cards with the film title, genre and rating. The user can click on the card and see more details about the film.
- **Details Page** - after clicking user can read more info about choosen movie and see similiar movies to choosen one
#### 🔖Later plans
- **Sign In** - in the future, I'd like to create the ability to create an account and add videos to user's own library
- **Video matching** - when the user adds a movie to the library, it will be taken into account the next time the movie is matched after answering the questions
